title: 30 Day Project - Day 8
---

Decided to tone down the frequency of blog post. Probably better to as I can't work on this project every single day, and it allows me to post about complete thoughts once I've accomplished something significant.

With that being said, I've implemented a number of things:

1. Grid controls that allow me to mouseover and highlight cells and click to change cell type.
2. A method to iterate through all neighbouring cells and return the sum of Alive cells.
3. Coroutine to update each of the cells status with the Conway algorithm.

Getting the algorithm working on screen was a big milestone. This puts me ahead of the weekly schedule that I've committed to. Now I can start to add the musical components, for that I need to do some research as I'm not too musically adept.
