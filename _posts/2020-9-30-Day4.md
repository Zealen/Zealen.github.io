Mostly scribbling some plans in my notebook today. I had to do some evening overtime today so I'm feeling pretty tired. I'm planning out how to structure my Grid and Cell classes.

The tentative plan with Cells is to map each one to a "Tile" in a Tilemap Gameobject. This can be done when the Grid and Cells are instantiated. Each Cell will hold the Alive or Dead status, the mapped tile asset, if the tile is highlighted by the mouse, and possibly some other stuff later down the road. All of these properties will be set by the Cell class.

The Grid Class will contain a 2d array of Cells based upon the size of the Tilemap GameObject. Said Tilemap will also be serialized in this class so I can attach it to any Tilemap Gameobject in the inspector. The primary method of this Class will be GetLivingNeighbourhoodSum, which will poll all 8 Cells around the target Cell and output the sum of Alive Cells. Care must be taken with the bounds of the matrix on the edges.

Beyond that there will be even more Classes that handle the Grid in GridManager, a singleton class that facilitate all actions towards the grid. This Class may possibly control the music "steps" as well. Another Class will be GridController, this will forward all user input to the GridManager.
