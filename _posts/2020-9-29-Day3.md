Working with Unity Test assembly files turned out to be kind of frustrating. I eventually got it working, but the assembly dependencies really threw me off for a while. 

Typically a test suite wants to be compiled separately from the main application. It's easy enough to reference the main assembly within Visual Studio, but Unity generates the assembly automatically when compiling so there is no assembly to reference.

The solution for me was to just make an assembly for Conway.Library. Makes sense, its a different entity from the core code and doesn't have dependencies. I can then reference this assembly within the Test assembly.

_Now I can reference my library in my test assembly_

Now I can finally start filling out the tests. Following the simple format:
1. Setup
2. Action
3. Result

We are given two parameters, one being the current cell state and the other being living neighbours. For each test setup these parameters must be setup. Since there are 8 different tiles surrounding each tile, each test can effectively test each relevant iteration with a Range in the method header.

The action defines what we are doing with the setup parameters. In these tests we are simply fetching the cell state given the parameters.

Lastly, we compare the expected state with the resulted state.

Implementing the method GetCellState was made trivial after these tests were in place. I was left with a few if() statements that were further refactored.
