title: 30 Day Project - Day 30
---

I didn't finish everything that I wanted to this project, but that wasn't the point. I made a plan, followed through with the implementation, and have an end product.

There were certainly things that I could have improved upon and I might go back and touch on those things. I could have made the code a bit cleaner and modular and refactored the code to make it SOLID, but given the time constraint I'm happy with the end results.

Since the last update I've added a highlight cell animation whenever a note plays. This accomplished two of the goals in one from the previous post as the user can now see the 'step' progression. In addition, I've also resolved the previous WebGL issues I was having before and my application now appears correctly within the web player.

The reason why I don't have any screenshots this post is because you can try out the application yourself!

Working on this project has been really enjoyable, and the blog was a great way to hold myself accountable to making at least a little progress during the week. I'll definitely be doing a 30 day project again.
