I've decided to take the TDD approach to creating algorithm itself. Unity has made its testing tools easier to use recently, and this is a good opportunity to try it out.

_Setting up Unit Tests using the Test Runner_

Setting it up was pretty easy. The Test Runner asks you to create a test folder and assembly that it will utilize. From there, you just create a regular NUnit C# file (also right from the Unity menu).

There are two types of NUnit tests. The first is the normal kind of Unit Test that runs without any dependencies. The second is called a UnityTest that works from either Play mode or the Editor. Since the algorithm won't be including any game objects, I'll be sticking to regular NUnit tests for now.

_The two types of Unit Tests_

I'll leave off today with the skeleton of some of the tests I want to run. I also want to research into how I can easily do iterations of the same test with different values using this setup. These four samples were derived directly from the algorithm:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
