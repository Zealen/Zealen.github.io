title: 30 Day Project - Day 1
---

Welcome to the resuscitation of a project that I had kicking around since earlier in the year.

The idea is based around the concept of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Interesting chaotic patterns produced by the algorithm can be captured and turned into a music generator of sorts. The idea in short will include a grid where each cell corresponds to various sounds. As the algorithm transforms, each cell in the grid that is occupied will play a sound in sequence along the x axis.

The image below is one of the patterns that can form from the Game of Life. There are several of these patterns that can emerge amid the chaos of the algorithm. However, in the application I am planning these won't be welcome as randomness will be promoted. As such, "locked" cells can be placed in the grid to break up such patterns and to facilitate a rhythm.

I opened my project to a mess of different assets I was intending to use. While pondering whether I should scrap the entire thing, I figured I could at least try to implement the algorithm at a base level and worry about visual assets later.

The plan is to create the algorithm within the constraints of the application. Thus, a simple matrix will suffice for testing initially. However, there are some challenges to implementing the algorithm:

1. Testing visually can be difficult and time consuming. Unit testing and simulating a specific input will result in a better working algorithm.
2. The walls of the grid are a new addition to this specific implementation. Will the walls continue on the opposite side of the axis? Or should they cease to exist past the bounds of the grid? Maybe there are invisible buffer cells on the outside bounds of the grid?

There are plenty of resources out there guiding exactly how to implement the algorithm in any given language, but I will be attempting my own solution using only the rules:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
