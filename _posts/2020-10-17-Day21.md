title: 30 Day Project - Day 21
---

Haven't posted in a while due to Holidays and other things, but I've made significant progress on the project between now and the last posting.

I've been working in FL Studio to create a set of notes to use. While doing my research I got some help and was recommended using a Pentatonic scale as mixtures of notes within the scale generally sound good together. I played around with an FL Plugin until I had sounds that I was happy with.

Afterwards I implemented the sounds into my project and created a singleton AudioManager to play them. Here I worked with a scriptable object to store a set of sound samples. Doing this will allow me to change the sounds easily in the future. I went back and used the same technique to change the Tileset and Gridsize to make that easier to modify.

The next task was to create a method to iterate through each column and construct "chords". Each time the algorithm fires, each columns alive cells are added to a list as a "chord". I created a coroutine to dequeue a list of cells every x seconds based upon a speed variable in settings.

Lastly, I managed to get it working on my Android but failed to put it on Web. For some reason when I host it on a webpage it displays a black screen, yet all of the controls and sounds work. Not sure what thats about.


The 30th day is creeping up and there are a few things I want to finish before then:

1. Add a step progress bar to highlight the currently playing column.
2. Add lighting effects for each individual cell
3. Change the transparency of the cells to make them more visible.
4. Push the application to Google Play Store

These are the for sure changes I want to make, but there are several unlisted that could to the polish.

For now, heres a demo of the app in action:
